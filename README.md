### Language
Ingext uses the Fluency Programming Language, that is a mix between JavaScript and GoLang

## Core Language
This is the language definition for the Fluency Programming Language (FPL). FPL was created as an easy-to-learn language that can be used to process data in a stream. The design of the stream is to be able to manipuate data in a stream efficiently, allowing higher throughput than a scripting language can perform.

## Extensions
These are a series of additional functions that are used for the Ingext stream operating system.
